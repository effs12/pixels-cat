# Pixels Cat
> Pixel Cat is part of my training in "mastering the basics" using React Class Component and React Functional Component. It is inspired by the Udemy course Practice Building Robohash. What I did is adding some twist by converting the robohash kittens into pixelated textures using React Pixelate and use the material UI for components. (see demo here [https://pixels-cat.vercel.app/])
